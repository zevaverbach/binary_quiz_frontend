# Design
- color and font
- toggleable column labels
- animations
  - [x] 'nuh-uh' shake for wrong answers
  - [ ] nice reward animations for right answers
  - [ ] make the placeholders become real text for a split second before starting
- processor graphic/animation
  - diff processors for different bits

## mobile
  - make autofocus work on quiz
  - remove "[enter]" from start button
  - on-screen keyboard, like wordle
  - make it all on one line 
    - make the font smaller or the div wider
  - put a 'submit' button in (or auto-submit?)
  - add a range slider for easier input?
